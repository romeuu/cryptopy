# CryptoPY

CryptoPY is a basic script that compares five cryptocurrencies (for now), those are BTC, ETH, XRP, XMR and USDT. <br/>
Amongst all the functionalities of the script, there are two key ones, the **alert system** (currently being developed) and **monitoring prices for x seconds**, with the last one you are able to check the prices for the seconds you want to, you can even run the script all day long, so in case the price drops beyond the limit you have stipulated, you get an email.
